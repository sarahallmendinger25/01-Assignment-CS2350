    <h1>The User Interface Career</h1>
    <p>As stated on the home page, this field specifically refers to digitally-facing design. This refers to the way that a user interacts with a digital product, and the ease of use.</p>
    <p>Some examples of elements a UI Designer would focus on would be clickable buttons, stylistic choices, and layout of the interface. The goal is for the user to easily accomplish the task that they seek to achieve by using the visual designs curated specifically for that product.</p>

            <h2>What is the Difference Between UX and UI Roles?</h2>
            <p>One of the key differences between the definitions of these roles is that a User Experience career can expand beyond digital role and be used for physical design of a product, while a User Interface career is specifically a digital-based field.These roles go hand-in-hand, however. The UX designer will determine what the client is looking for in an experience, and the UI designer will implement the functionality and style of the interface.</p>
